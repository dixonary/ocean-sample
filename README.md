# ocean-sample

How to set up:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have latest flixel (4.3.0) installed and its dependencies. I recommend `haxelib setup .` inside this folder, which makes sure libraries won't interfere.
3. run `lime test neko` or `lime test cpp` at your leisure.

This one has some controls set up:

1/2/3/4: Resize the ocean sprite.
+/-: Rotate the sprite.
